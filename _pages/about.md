I'm a PhD Student in Machine Learning Applications at UTC.

My research interests are in computer vision and anomaly detection.

My thesis topic is about Deep Learning models for Anomaly Detection in Industry 4.0.

I'm also interested in philosophy. My favorite scholars are [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche) and [Gautama Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Buddha).
