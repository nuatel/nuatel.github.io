👋 **Hello there, I'm Tuan!**

👨‍💻 I'm a PhD Student in Machine Learning Applications at the Univeristy of Technology of Compiegne.

🔬 My research interests are in computer vision and anomaly detection.

📚 I'm also interested in philosophy. My favorite scholars are [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche) and [Gautama Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Buddha).
